//! Alternating Cross Interpolation for tree tensor networks.
//!
//! This crate operates directly on [`tensor4all_treetn::TreeTN`] and keeps the
//! tree topology throughout interpolation. Unlike `tensor4all-aci`, it imposes
//! no path-order requirement: any validated tree topology is accepted, and no
//! `TensorTrain` conversion happens at any point.
//!
//! # Maturity
//!
//! **This is not yet a drop-in replacement for `tensor4all-aci`.** On a chain,
//! where the two are directly comparable, it reaches the same accuracy at the
//! same or lower rank for no more function evaluations, but remains several
//! times slower end to end (roughly 2.8x-6.0x on `tensor4all-aci`'s
//! `treeaci_parity` benchmark, chain, bond dimension 16 through 128, and
//! still growing with bond dimension, though much less steeply than before).
//! Candidate/pivot-search frame contraction, and sample materialization
//! (`from_samples`/`extend`) for single-incoming-edge nodes (which covers
//! every node on a chain), now both route through a BLAS matrix-multiply
//! primitive instead of a per-candidate/per-sample scalar loop;
//! multi-incoming-edge nodes (genuine tree branch points, not exercised by
//! the chain benchmark) still use the original per-candidate/per-sample
//! scalar path on both.
//!
//! Prefer `tensor4all-aci` for chain topologies. Use this crate when the
//! topology is genuinely a tree, where the alternative is not a slower run but
//! no run at all.
